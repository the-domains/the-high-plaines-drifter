<p>Having a contrarian opinion can be a bad thing if you don't have the data to back it up and, in my book, product first methodologies like lean have been suspect for awhile. As an entrepreneur, I've been finding that this is not a popular position to take. Lean has an almost cult-like following and status, but I'm not sure why especially after looking at the numbers.</p><ul><li>startups fail at a rate greater than 90% (over simplified but pretty close) -<a data-mce-href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/28/silicon-valley-startup-failure-culture-success-myth" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/28/silicon-valley-startup-failure-culture-success-myth">The Guardian</a></li><li>40% of startups fail not because of no market fit, but continue to operate in a zombie mode -<a data-mce-href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/startup-failure-reasons-top/" href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/startup-failure-reasons-top/">CBInsights</a></li><li>40% fail due to lack of business operations -<a data-mce-href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/startup-failure-reasons-top/" href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/startup-failure-reasons-top/">CBInsights</a></li><li>For more stories of failed startups check out<a href="http://autopsy.io/" data-mce-href="http://autopsy.io/">Autopsy.io - Lessons from failed startups</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tullman" data-mce-href="https://twitter.com/tullman">Howard Tullman</a>of 1871 has an insightful piece in INC called "<a href="http://www.inc.com/howard-tullman/busting-the-lean-startup-myth.html" data-mce-href="http://www.inc.com/howard-tullman/busting-the-lean-startup-myth.html">Busting the Lean-Startup Myth</a>" where he asks the questions "<em>Is there "V"[V = Value] in your "MVP"</em>?" He goes on to say<em>"I'm not sure when it got to be Okay to try to do the least work possible in developing something that you are seriously trying to do well".</em>To his point, there is a lack of balance in how early-stage companies build businesses. So much of their energies goes toward product development and so little goes toward basic business considerations. It's no wonder the failure rate is so high.</p><p>So why then is the adherence to lean modalities so prevalent? Probably a confluence of variables including a lack of understanding of fundamental business concepts that come with experience. A touch of mob mentality, or a fear of being different from the pack. From my own experience, I know the feeling of rolling out a product only months after I had an idea. It's like a drug, a real high. For me, it was an adrenaline rush akin to riding my motorcycle at 100mph down the expressway with a lot less risk of bodily harm (something I did when I was young and stupid).</p><p>On paper, Lean makes a ton of sense and in its purest from it probably works, but as is often the case paper and practice are two different things. I've had plenty of conversations with die-hard believers. The typical rebut; "Read the book(which I have), it is about building a business, and the high failure rate is due to a lack of understanding of the core concepts." Maybe that's true, but from the perspective of outcomes it kind of doesn't matter. Also, if it is the case that the massive rate failure is due to a misunderstanding of concepts, then that's a whole other problem.</p><p><strong>There's a better way!</strong><br>David Collis in his HBR article "<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/03/lean-strategy" data-mce-href="https://hbr.org/2016/03/lean-strategy">Lean Strategy</a>" he talks about<em>"integrating the bottom-up approach of Lean start-ups with the top-down orientation of strategic management remains devilishly hard. Is there a way to get the best of both worlds?"</em></p><p>The effectiveness of a process is a function of effort and resource consumption measured by outcomes. It's a continuum, and on one side is product first frameworks like Lean on the other are the corporate over engineered analysis paralysis process. There is a sweet<g data-gr-id="85">spot</g>though. We call it Prove-E-Ness. Coined by J.B. Davis with a little shout out to Steven Colbert, Prove-E-Ness is the balance point between effort and resource utilization resulting in a net positive outcome.</p><p><strong>Here's an example -</strong><br>A potential client come to us with ideas. Usually, they are relatively compelling as a starting point for conversation. Here are the kinds of questions we ask and the kind of answers we get:</p><p>Q: What is the target market?<br>A: Men between 25 and 45, Woman who run, Mom's, People who play video games </p><p>Q: Who are the possible competitors?<br>A: No one is doing what I want to do, Amazon, I don't know, I don't have any</p><p>Q: How are you going to make money?<br>A: I will get paid for ..., Advertising!, Haven't figure that our yet</p><p>After a few more questions about things like customer acquisition costs and margins we stop the conversation, but not before the are asked questions like ; "How long it would take to build a platform as functional as Uber ?(wasn't Uber, but scale was the same)." or they say something like "I validated the idea by running a test on Facebook with my friends and everyone loved it."</p><p><strong>Let's apply some Prove-E-Ness to this</strong>.<br>Target market: Men between 25 and 45, that's a pretty big market. It's worth taking a week maybe two, to do some research, talk to some real live people (strangers not friends) and narrow that down a bit. The ROI on that week or two is exponential.</p><p>Competitors: Just about all customer's time and dollars are accounted for so if you are going try and carve out market share you are going to be taking time and dollars from an existing channel. Therefore, you are competing with someone for something. Let's figure out who.</p><p>Making Money aka The Business Model. It perfectly fine to have an idea of how a business is going to make money. It is unacceptable to start developing a product without developing at least a straw man version of a Pro-Forma. In two week you have some idea of your customer acquisition costs, margins, and other costs, and have a means of tracking financial health.</p><p>A healthy business is one that has been modeled holistically from day one. We call this Viable Growth Solutions and the output is not an MVP, but an MVB or minimum viable business.</p><p>Granted there is a bit more discipline and businessy work that is not as sexy as product development early on. If you're going to be dropping dimes on developers, take a month and find a couple of folks that know how to do market analysis and develop financial models.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="28"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="30"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="31"><span data-reactid="32"><!-- react-empty: 33 --><h2 data-reactid="34"><a data-reactid="35">The High Plaines Drifter</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="37"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="38"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="39"></div></section></div></div>
