What if I told you that 2015 saw over $60 Billion of funding sunk into early stage companies? What if I told you that well over 90% of those companies are going to fail?  What if I also told you that almost none of these companies have a positive social impact as part of their corporate DNA?  Crazy right? But it's the truth. The traditional startup funding model is broken; it leaves a tremendous amount of economic and social capital on the table. 

We at Month16 are hell bent on building a better framework for success; be it the entrepreneur hacking their way through a culture of build product then business, or legacy business lost in the swirl and pace of innovation. Opportunity abides

I, the High Plains Drifter and an agent of Month16, am here to tell you there's a better way of putting odds more in one's favor. But it comes with a change in mindset. It's going to be hard for some to accept. Change always is. There will be detractors, cause there always are. This is the first in series of posts, we will build a framework from which success and value will be more readily achievable. Think of it as Moneyball for business. 

What makes me qualified to make such statement?  All of us, whether we know it or not, are on a journey.  We make choices and decisions, we expel effort, we experience outcomes, we analyze results and apply the findings to the next series choices or decisions. Frequency and amplitude may vary, but we all experience our own patterns. None better or worse, just different. Different patterns lead to different insights. My Journey; educated in computer science. Jumped into the fire and started my first company in the Bay Area early on in the dot com era. Rode the bubble with failures and successes (I'll elaborate more thought out my posts), raised millions in funding for myself and others. learned business through experience and observation.  Tempered in corporate culture for 10+years. Did a short stint with a DC think tank focusing in transforming legacy news organizations, and headed up tech and ecommerce for a luxury chocolate company. Always surrounded myself with people smarter than myself. 

Why do we say the business/value creation process is fundamentally broken?

One the startup side:

* As stated about over $60 billion invested in startups over the last 4 quarters with single digit success rates.
* Product first development methodologies like Lean have obtained cult like status with lackluster results

* Top reasons for startup failure tied to lack of business foundation including: 
  * No market demand for product 
  * Lack of organizational structure 
  * General lack of business oversight
* False construct and understanding - profits vs community are not mutually exclusive  - Conscious companies have more opportunity for long term value creatio

On the legacy side:

* Over engineered processes
* Incentives focus on the short term profits
* Social commitment lives on the periphery
* Lack of agility  

**What's next**

Over the next few posts I will detail a framework for success based on the collective journeys of the Month16 leadership. But, in order to experience more success we first must explore the dynamics of failure. Which I will do in depth in the next post. Generally speaking,  the data is shocking, let me rephrase that, SHOCKING! I mean, as entrepreneur, I had always heard and have myself quoted the high stats of failure rates.  To some extent, it seemed to be more of a badge of honor than the deterrent it was meant to be. Because that's the heart of the innovator, to quote JFK "We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard." Part of our brains is for sure broken.  Most reasonable folks hear the numbers and run the other way. No not us, not the entrepreneur; we run towards the fire. To us it's a drive, a calling a compulsion defying logic and reason. An ebbing and flowing path of uncertainty made foggy by passion and singular perspective. More often than not the path leads to high expectations and underperformance. 

I'm a little older now and arguably a bit wiser. Looking back I ask myself, "Was all of that uncertainty necessary?" Nay, I say. And to the budding entrepreneur I say, "Don't go chasing unicorns (or waterfalls)". And what of the culture of product first worry about business later? To this, I say "the needle in and the damage done." It's the opiate of the enrapture. Man does it feel euphoric to see a sexy functional product hot off the presses and just weeks after inception.  It really gets the dopamine stoked. All your pals tell you how great it is. And not to worry cause because product-driven development assures market adoption, right? Test, analyze, develop,  repeat. (Link to lean lifecycle). Nope, instead each iteration is a fix. If there's one thing entrepreneurs are particularly good at, it is listening to feedback, accepting criticism, and knowing when to cut their losses(BTW that sarcasm). Granted, stubbornness also occupies a little part of the innovator's heart. But it's also a big contributor to failure in the form ignoring data on market fit or an "I know better than the market" attitude. CB Insights illustrates this point by noting that 40% of startup failure is due to no market need for a product.  Stubbornness is the main cause of startup Zombies, companies that don't know or won't accept their own death. 

Meanwhile, over in corporate confines, they're having their own issues.  I know this because of what my family resentfully refers to as the dark years. While I remember being my usual delightful self, my family seem to have an almost PTSD reaction when they reflect. Talk about culture shock. I went from the "build it now, plan later, it's all about the eyeballs west coast mindset" to the over-engineering "culture of no"  analysis paralysis of a 140-year-old multi-billion dollar legacy company. It was the equivalent of hitting a brick wall at 80 mph. I sustained serious injuries mostly in the form of brain damage.  Recovery consisted of developing an understand of High Agency. For this was the only mode of operation that would produce anything close to net positive results. For me, that meant asking for lots of forgiveness and little permission. End of the day my team built an e-commerce platform which generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually.  I say this not to brag(well, maybe a little) but more to set the stage for observations that would later lead to Month16's value creation process. 

Summary of  Observations - Startups:

-It's a culture of conferences and buzzwords

-Fueled impulse and immediate gratification 

-Low, low, low success rate. I mean low

-Super smart people being burned out 

-Lack of experienced oversight 

-Lots of zombies that don't know they're dead

-Unbelievable value left on the table 

-Product-driven development is a drug

Observations on Corporate:

-Gridlock caused by analysis paralysis

-Over-engineered process

-Executive misalignment 

-Tremendous loss of value in the form of redoing channels, supply chains 

-Inability to cope with rapid change

**Overall observation**

A general disconnect and lack of understanding about the idea of the Conscious Company. I'm not talking about tree hugging hippies. I'm talking about the fact that companies with conscious cultures tend to have the longer periods of constant value.

I am excited to be kicking off our first series looking at new framework for success starting with a look at failure. Yeah, you could read yet another post on the top habits of the most success people. As my therapist would say, "how's that working out for you?"
